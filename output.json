I wish they'd consider a more intuitive UX for this - like clicking on the item for it to pop-up with a list of everyone on the bill and selecting all those that it applied to. That said, it ROCKS and getting the ability to send the results of everything over text without anyone having to download the app gets rid of any concerns about if you split the bill correctly. Great job - would love to see this sold as a feature to a payment company like Venmo!"

I.e. if the table bought 6 sodas total, but one friend got 3, you got 2, and another friend got 1, there is no way to split the bill like that. I wish the people were color coded as well, so you could quickly see who was what on the bill."

It would be fantastic to have a flat fee option near the end that gets split equally among everyone for things like service fees or delivery fees. This fee shouldn't be taxed or influence it. I think once that gets added the app will be perfect to use In restaurants and for delivery services with friends. Seems like a perfect fit for this cpvid influenced world."
